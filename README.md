TCD CS7CS4 Machine Learning

Please check [20191014/training.py.ipynb](20191014/training.ipynb).
It is (might be, since I don't know which is the best result in private leaderboard) the final result.
The notebook contains some comments. I arranged the code blocks according to the columns I was tackling with.

Jobs done using code editors:

1. rename the training data 'Income' column
2. replace non-ascii characters for lightGBM: CÃ´te d'Ivoire => CCDD
